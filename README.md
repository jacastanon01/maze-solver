# MazeSolver

This is a small application that utilizes Tkinter as a GUI for a maze. The walls of the maze are randomly constructed and the maze is solved using a depth-first search, meaning you can watch as the algorithm traverse through the maze and backtracks until it finds the end.

## Setup
- Install python3 on your machine
- Clone this repo
- Run `./main.sh` at the root directory and follow the prompts in the CLI to specify the maze size
- Watch the maze do its thang
